"It's like frozen meals. Yes you can buy your meal frozen. But you can also cook for yourself and it will taste better in the end (mostly)"

"What I do is I sell myself as a service. Rather than using a CMS for the client to update their site, I build all my sites in just static html and css and sell a maintenance and hosting package for $150 a month. Unlimited edits, hosting, and lifetime updates. They love it. Most of these people don’t want to edit it themselves or maintain their site. They’d rather pay someone to handle everything for them. That’s what I sell. And it’s very popular. I have 35 monthly paying clients right now and counting. All of them are small business sites. So for $150 a month they have their own web developer partner in their pocket that they can call on anytime. And no, no one calls me at 3 am asking to change their text on the home page. It doesn’t happen. I think I did maybe 10 hours of total edits last year between all my clients. So no I am not getting run ragged from constant edits. They’re busy running their business. They don’t have time to obsess over their site and think of all new things to add. I sell peace of mind. And it’s pretty darn profitable.

It’s closer to $4300. I have a few discounts where I needed to make a sale. I go down to $99 a month to close the sale if I have to. I’d rather have $99 a month than 0 and I built all my own templates so I really just spend 4-5 hours adding content and image optimization and the site is done. So it’s very little cost in terms of time.

10 hours of edits all year for all total clients. Thats It. Not 10 per client. I only charge upfront fees if there’s more than 5 pages or it’s a bigger website.

Average company size is 1-10 employees

I don’t have anyone with large databases. I just recently started doing Shopify integrations after I started working with another backend developer who can take my custom code and integrate it into Shopify. Its amazing what he can do. I have 2 shops I’m working on now. It costs $850-$950 flat to do a Shopify integration.

That’s why I don’t use a CMS. They’re not tech savvy people. They’d rather have someone else doing their edits so why waste my time masking or hooking up and CMS when I can just as easily edit the html."
